# Genetic Algorithm Project

This project explores the implementation of genetic algorithms (GA) across different problem domains and data representations. It is divided into two main sections:

## Section 1: Crossover and Mutation Techniques

In this section, we implement and demonstrate various crossover and mutation techniques tailored to different types of data representations:

- **Binary Representation**
  - 1-point, Uniform
  - Simple
- **Integer Representation**
  - n-point
  - Creep, Random
- **Floating-Point Representation**
  - Simple arithmetic, Whole arithmetic, Blend
  - Uncorrelated mutation with one σ, Uncorrelated mutation with n σ’s

## Section 2: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The second section focuses on solving the TSP using a permutation representation. We utilize specific genetic operators optimized for this problem:

- **Crossover Operators:**
  - PMX (Partially Mapped Crossover)
  - Edge Crossover
- **Mutation Operators:**
  - Inversion Mutation
  - Scramble Mutation

This section demonstrates the application of genetic algorithms to a well-known optimization problem, showcasing the efficacy of different genetic operators in finding solutions.
